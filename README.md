# lecture-notebooks
This repository includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that complement my robotics programming courses.

Jupyter notebooks are files that contain text, figures as well as executable code and code output. You can either view the notebooks statically or interactively, which allows you to run and modify code cells.

# Usage

You can view the notebooks using four ways:

1. Online Preview:
    * You can directly preview them here on GitHub
    * However, the notebooks will not be interactive

2. Interactive Online Preview using Binder
    * **Basics Notebook:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SimonSchwaiger/lecture-notebooks/HEAD?labpath=app%2FNotebooks%2FBasics.ipynb)

3. Local Preview using VSCode
    * TODO

4. Local Preview Using Docker and Jupyterlab
    * TODO
