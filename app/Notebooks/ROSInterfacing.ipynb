    "4. Open another terminal and use `rostopic pub /hello_world std_msgs/String \"data: 'Hello from terminal 3'\" -1` to send a message to the second terminal through ROS. `std_msgs/String` denotes the ROS datatype, while `\"data: 'Hello from terminal 3!'\"` sets the message and `-1` causes the message to be sent only once.\n",

Since ROS is natively compatible with Python, a Jupyter notebook can interact with ROS as a standard ROS node. Once initialized, the node is active and can publish/subscribe to topics, provide/consume services, and interact with the ROS ecosystem. We can only initialise one node per notebook, since all notebook cells share a common Python kernel. Furthermore, each node name in a ROS system must be unique."
